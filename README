Inspired during a Javascript workshop at HackReactor. Please don't publish this work in progress but feel free to download and tinker. I welcome your collaboration and comments.

Fans of juvenile literature (and I mean JUVENILE) may recognize another source of inspiration from "Captain Underpants and the Perilous Plot of Professor Poopypants" by Dav Pilkey. As the story goes, an idealistic inventor named Pippy P. Poopypants has invented two machines that can produce enough food to feed the entire world. Unfortunately, he runs out of money to bring his idea to market so he decides to get a job as an elementary school science teacher where the kids laugh at his name and "Professor P. Goes CRA-Z". Among his ensuing evil deeds, he creates a low-tech invention called "The Name Change-o-chart 2000" and makes all the kids change their names. I won't spoil the ending, but if you want to emulate a slightly higher-tech version of The Name Change-o-Chart 2000, click the "Captain Underpants" button!

I have attempted to contact Mr. Pilkey for his blessing. Shakespeare was not available for comment.
